  - William actually runs a decently successful paint store. His most popular paint
    is called Spring Fairy.
  - Since William goes to the beach very often, he will often come across noisy tourists
    that ruin his midday nap in the shade. This is the reason he has grown to dislike
    people who disregard other people's feelings
